Iâ€™m a high school math-teacher turned backend programmer! 

I started learning Python through the MIT opencourseware several years ago, and am currently working on to Turingâ€™s backend opencourseware program. I love problem solving most of all, but numbers and data arenâ€™t bad either. Iâ€™ve worked with Ruby, Python and SQL. I am a great learner, whether itâ€™s self-taught or from another person. 

I come home from my day-job as a math teacher, spend time with my family, and then hunker down on opencourseware and other online programs to develop my backend programming skills. In my free time I enjoy tinkering withâ€¦pretty much anything!  Retro gaming systems, emulators, pixel art, or amateur woodworking. I also enjoy reading sci-fi, fantasy, historical fiction, or mysteries.
